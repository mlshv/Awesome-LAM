# Awesome-LAM

Awesome-LAM is a curated list dedicated to the innovative world of Large Action Models (LAMs), a term introduced by the Rabbit R1 research team in their research paper ["Learning human actions on computer applications"](https://www.rabbit.tech/research). LAMs are a new area in artificial intelligence, expanding upon the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transforming them into autonomous 'agents' capable of executing tasks independently. This repo offers key info on LAMs, including studies, tools, and companies actively working in this field.
